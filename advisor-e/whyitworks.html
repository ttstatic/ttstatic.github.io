          <p class="subtitle is-3"><span class="has-text-grey">Question:&nbsp;</span>What is a conceptual hierarchy and why are they so important to learning and dealing with radical change?</p>
          <div class="content is-size-5">
            <p><strong class="has-text-primary">Answer:&nbsp;</strong>In strictly educational terms, a Conceptual Hierarchy is the 'breaking down' of a topic (Concept) into levels of complexity that range from general to specific. From a 'brain processing' perspective (Cognition) it's about&nbsp;<strong>how the brain processes new information based on the recognition and association of past information</strong>.</p>
            <p>The saying 'A picture speaks a thousand words' is one way to think of a conceptual hierarchy; it's the utilisation of multiple pieces of information, all interrelating and when supported by Auditory or Kinesthetic involvement, helps the brain to 'trap the information' with greater efficiency.</p>
            <p>The beauty of working with Frameworks is that they allow you to build your understanding 'on top' of what you already know,&nbsp;<strong>making learning faster</strong>. Once skilled, you can easily replicate your thinking with others or 'cross apply' it to different topics using the same framework structure.&nbsp;<strong>In effect, you learn from patterns and then when working with clients, you look for signs of those same patterns</strong>.</p>

          <p class="subtitle is-3"><span class="has-text-grey">Question:&nbsp;</span>Where did the Growth Fundamentals Framework come from?</p>
          <div class="content is-size-5">
            <p><strong class="has-text-primary">Answer:&nbsp;</strong>The framework was developed by Mike Barnes to make coaching accountants to deliver advisory services so much easier. Mike has 17 yrs. experience in working with directors to grow their 'A' list clients whilst helping them build the skills within their team to develop the 'B's' and the 'C's'.</p>
            <p>The thing that Mike realised was that most accountants lacked the contextual awareness to know when to apply certain business (problem solving) formulas. This was evident, even with experienced directors and even in cases where a sound knowledge of the formula existed. In effect, they knew how to identify the ‘jigsaw piece' but struggled to know where to 'place it'.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="subtitle is-3"><span class="has-text-grey">Question:&nbsp;</span>So why was Advisor-E.com formed?</p>
          <div class="content is-size-5">
            <p><strong class="has-text-primary">Answer:&nbsp;</strong>Mike was approached by several of the accounting firms that were successfully using the framework to grow their fee base and asked if it was possible to make the tools even easier to access; if the templates could be white labelled and most importantly, able to be shared with their clients via a cloud based portal.</p>
            <p>These same firms then stepped forward with an initial technology investment and agreed to participate in the Beta testing and the on-going improvement of the portal and its content. In addition to this, David Heald agreed to ‘come on board' to help with the focused development of more ‘mainstream' (yet still advanced) Accounting service offers.</p>
