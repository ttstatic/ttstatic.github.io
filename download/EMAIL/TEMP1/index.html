                </p>
                <br>
                <hr>
                <br>

                <p>
                    The agreed board evaluation process is as follows:

                    <br>
                    <br><strong>Phase 1: Complete the online evaluation</strong>
                    <br> The online evaluation is a series of multiple choice questions which takes approximately 30 minutes to complete. Can you please December 10, 2016.

                    <br>
                    <br>Shortly you will receive your unique login details. If you fail to receive these within 2 working days, please contact Governance Evaluator to have them resent.
                    <br>
                    <br>On the left hand side you will see the evaluation.  Click on start and commence the evaluation.  When you have finished each of the modules you don’t need to do anything.  The results are automatically stored for the next phase. You can access your individual results by clicking on the tab at the completion of your evaluation.
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>
                    <br><strong>Phase 2: Individual Director Interviews</strong>
                    <br>The online evaluation is a series of multiple choice questions which takes approximately 30 minutes to Confidential director interviews will be conducted on the week of December. They take approximately 45 minutes to complete and will be undertaken over the phone.

                    <br>
                    <br>The purpose of these interviews is to go through your individual results and the board aggregate results.  In most instances there will be some anomalies between individual director and the group results.  This is due to governance experience, length of time of that board, specific expertise of the director and the like.  &lt;name of independent convenor&gt; will be in contact shortly to schedule a suitable time for your interview.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <br>
                    <br><strong>Phase 3: Board Planning Session</strong>

                    <br>
