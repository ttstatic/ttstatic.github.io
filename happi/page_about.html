          <p>Happi is a Singapore based community platform that enables people to be heard and contribute to causes, charities, teams, schools, student activity groups and community groups they care about in a fun, free, and easy way.</p>
          <p> <strong>“Small Acts for Big Impact” </strong>is our mantra. We give people a way to support something they care about in a free, easy way with just 30 seconds a day. You answer 5 questions to drive donations to your cause, get great deals on high quality products and services you select, and you just may win the stuff you select in our lucky draws and Random Acts of Happiness.</p>
          <p>First, we find charities, community groups, student groups, non-profit organizations and/or enterprises with a strong social objective, which strive to make a positive difference in their communities or workforces.  As long as there are people who care about that group and what it does, we want to support that group as one of our <strong>Partners.</strong></p>
          <p>We provide each Partner with a code their supporters or employees use when they register for a free Happi account. This enables us to contribute more money to each Partner based on their people’s participation. We give Partners money for every person who signs up for an account, each time they select something they want to win and take a 5 question survey. After the survey, the user will get a discount-enabling coupon for that item on their phone or computer. There's no obligation to buy the item, but, if they do, Happi will donate another $5 to the group. Finally, we also give $10,000 in funding for every 50,000 smiles a partner group consumes.</p>
          <p>In addition to financial support, we enable our Partners to further develop their communities with free publicity of their good work in the Happi Stories section of the app. This is how people can see how much money their participation has driven to the Partner, how much money Happi has provided in total, and what the Partner has done or is doing with Happi’s contributions. We also help each Partner with corporate sponsorship development and, when we can, help Partners find ways they can assist each other with special projects or events.</p>
          <p>Because we know a lot about our Members’ interests and passions, we can do a pretty good job of finding products, services and experiences that many Members will find attractive.  That’s where our <strong>Suppliers </strong>come in. We enable our Suppliers to promote offers designed to make our Members happy. The advertisement is free. The Supplier pays us a fee when a Member buys one of their offers, and we give that money to the Member’s selected Partner. We also buy all the prizes we give to our members from our suppliers.</p>
          <p>So, who funds all of this? That’s where the <strong>Sponsors </strong>come in. Every survey question, every promotion, every event invite, every focus group invitation that appears on Happi is there because one of our Sponsors paid for it to be there. Our Sponsors are brands, market researchers, media, and sometimes our Partners and Suppliers. The support of these Sponsors makes Happi possible…..and that support will continue only if our Members respond to surveys frequently and honestly. That’s all that is necessary for this perfect Social Enterprise send millions of dollars a year to community groups globally. Just give your honest opinion to 5 questions a day.</p>
          <p>It sounds too good to be true...and maybe it is...Happi is an experiment to see what will happen if we give people a fun, free, fast way to support causes they care about. If enough people get behind this idea and participate, it will work. Will you be one of the ones who watch or one of the people who get behind this and make it work for everyone?</p>
